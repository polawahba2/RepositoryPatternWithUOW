RepositoryPatternWithUOW

Overview
This repository demonstrates how to implement the Repository Pattern with Unit of Work (UoW) in ASP.NET Core using Dapper and Entity Framework Core (EF Core). It provides a clean and maintainable way to manage database operations while following best practices for abstraction, testability, and performance.

Features
✅ Repository Pattern – Encapsulates database logic for better separation of concerns.
✅ Unit of Work (UoW) – Ensures atomic transactions and manages multiple repositories efficiently.
✅ Dapper & EF Core – Supports both lightweight and full-featured ORM approaches.
✅ Dependency Injection – Uses IDbConnection for flexibility and testability.
✅ Asynchronous Operations – Implements async/await for better scalability.
✅ Logging & Exception Handling – Uses ILogger to track errors and performance.
